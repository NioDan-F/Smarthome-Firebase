## Features

* **Lighting control:** Turn lights on/off in different rooms.
* **Environmental monitoring:** Monitor temperature, humidity, and gas levels in real-time.
* **Appliance control:** Control fans and water pumps remotely.
* **Security:** Secure door access with fingerprint authentication.
* **Fire alarm:**  Detect potential fire hazards with gas and temperature sensors, triggering an alarm and sending notifications.
* **Automated watering:** Automatically activate a water pump based on soil moisture levels.
* **Dual control interface:** Control and monitor the system through both a mobile application and an HMI touchscreen.
